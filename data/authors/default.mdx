Hi, my name is Ega Alifya Firnando and I am a Fullstack Web Developer with 2 years of experience. I am skilled in web development using Laravel and I often combine it with frontend frameworks like React.js and Vue.js. I have a passion for creating user-friendly and efficient web applications that meet all business requirements.

In addition to my web development skills, I am also interested in Linux administration. I enjoy learning new technologies and am always looking for ways to improve my skills. I am a team player and always strive to maintain a positive work environment. I look forward to new challenges and opportunities to contribute to the success of any project I work on.
